Scalability Testing Methodology

1.Run tests for 10 threads, 20 threads, …. 100 threads. Each run must be at least 10 minutes, and you must pass little’s law described above
2.Throughput must increase in proportion to the number of threads. Response time must not increase as the number of threads increases
3.If the throughput does not increase - STOP and Investigate
4.Look at graphs for client network bandwidth, server network, I/O, CPU, Memory, database graphs, graphs for redis/cache, number of workers configured on web servers, etc.
5.You will find that one of these components is slowing down the entire system. Find the culprit
6.Once you know the culprit, fix the problem
7.Now run the tests again, and increase load till throughput becomes constant.
8..Once you get your target throughput and an acceptable 95 percentile response time, you are done
