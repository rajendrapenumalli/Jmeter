The User Defined Variables element lets you define an initial set of variables, just as in the Test Plan
Note: All the UDV elements in a test plan – no matter where they are – are processed at the start

Name: It’s the name of the variable which you will use in another place. The syntax to call that variable in JMeter is:
${VARIABLE_NAME}
Value: It’s the value corresponding to the variable in the Name column. The whole ${VARIABLE_NAME} 
will then be replaced by the string in the “Value” column.
For simplicity, it is suggested that UDVs are placed only at the start of a Thread Group (or perhaps under the Test Plan itself).
