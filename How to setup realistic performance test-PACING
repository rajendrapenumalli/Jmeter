What is a real-world performance test
------------------------------------------------------------
Think Time - simulate actual user actions with timings/delays 

Pacing - controlled ramp-up and down of virtual users
      - control timing between iterations
     - achieve x iterations in y mins/sec

Step 1 - Add Plugin - Stepping Thread Group
Step 2 - Setup load with required settings
Step 3 - Run and validate
