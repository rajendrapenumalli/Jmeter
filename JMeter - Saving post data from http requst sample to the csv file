Add JSR223 PostProcessor as a chid of the HTTP Request sampler
Put the following code into "Script" area:

import groovy.json.JsonSlurper
def request = new JsonSlurper().parseText(sampler.getArguments().getArgument(0).getValue())
def email = request.email
def password = request.password
new File('test.csv') << email + ',' + password + System.getProperty('line.separator')

Once you execute your test the JSR223 PostProcessor will add the values of email and password objects into test.csv file 
(normally it should reside in "bin" folder of your JMeter installation)
